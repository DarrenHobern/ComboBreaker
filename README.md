# ComboBreaker
A small indie game I made.

CURRENTLY REQUIRES A CONTROLLER

Controls:
  Left stick: Aim
  D-Pad:      Boost
  Face buttons/Bumpers: the buttons to press
  Triggers:   button modifiers - Blue=Left | Red =Right | weird-other-one=Both
 
 Wonky Things:
  Currently settings menu requires mouse
  If you run without a controller Alt-F4 to quit
